## Understand how Slack works

This is a short guide on the basics of Slack. If you are new to this type of app, we recommend starting with the [101 Guide](https://slack.com/resources/slack-101) they provide.

If you use Facebook, Whatsapp, or similar communication tools, you should be able to start using Slack right away. No harm in figuring it out as you go along. You can edit and delete everything you do! No more scrolling through your inbox! Mobile friendly!

The primary goal of Slack is to have a private space for gui2de staff and RAs to talk and ask questions about projects and methods. Information is easily ‘lost’ in email or whatsapp. Slack is a hybrid of those two apps. It’s like the best features of social media with the searchability and work focus of email. There are a few important things to keep in mind to get accustomed to Slack

### Channels

On the left hand side of Slack you will see a bunch of channels. These are categories to bring focus to conversations. A same project can have multiple channels, and the convention is to start the channel name with the project, so they are sorted accordingly and easy to find. The purpose of using these channels is to isolate conversations. This makes it easier to find information relevant to your interests or needs.

The public **#help** channels (one generic #help and a few specific ones like: **#help-code**, **#help-surveys**) can be used to ask questions that can build general knowledge and sharing among the team. The **#staff-only** channel is for RAs and staff to ask questions or share tips without PIs in the channel. Ask for help about slack in the dedicaed **#help-slack** channel.

You will find a lot of channels have a section for Pinned Items. Answers to common questions are found in pinned documents and messages. If you want to talk about something but can’t find a channel that fits your need, try picking one that is the closest. Even if it’s the **#general** channel. Over time, if a certain category of questions or messages grows bigger, we may split it off into its own channel.

To join a channel, click on the + next to the Channel and Browse Channels. You can read more about Channels in [this guide](https://slack.com/resources/slack-101/lesson-6-collaborate-effectively-in-channels2).

### Threads

This is one of the most important features you use in Slack. When you post a message in Slack, you have the option of replying to that message in a thread. Think about it like a comment/reply thread on Facebook. Slack does not stop you from replying to messages in the main channel. Given how large the team is, this could get overwhelming quickly. Imagine if every Facebook comment was a separate post! It would be hard to read.

A good use case of threads so far has been collecting feedback on a given deliverable: each piece of feedback can be a separate comment/response to the thread, and we can use the reaction emojis (like the tickmark) to confirm it has been taken into account.

### Messages

You can have private messages with anyone on the workspace, as well as groups of people on Slack. It is like an instant messenger service.

Everything you post in Slack is considered a message. You can attach files, change the format, make things bold etc, all within the message panel that sits at the bottom of your screen.

The Return to send and Shift + Return to add a new line makes it very easy to accidentally post messages before you finish writing them. If you prefer to use Return to make new lines--which is more similar to email--you can change your preferences using the guide [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005523006-Add-a-send-button-to-the-message-field)

You can always edit or delete messages after you post them. You simply click on the three vertical dots when you hover your cursor over a message to open up a menu. You edit the message and hit Save.

### Notifications

One of the things that makes Slack helpful is how notifications work. On other apps --like email or whatsapp-- you have no control over what messages notify you. It’s all or nothing. Every message is considered worthy of a notification. On Slack, you can control notifications on your computer vs your phone. You can control which channels give you a notification. And you can mute channel activity temporarily. You can skip channel notifications entirely and only worry about messages sent directly to you like a text message.

As a reminder, messages can be posted inside a channel, or directly to another person, or to a group of people (like whatsapp). [Here](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Guide-to-desktop-notifications#channel-specific-group-dm-notifications) is the guide on notifications using the desktop app. [Here](https://slack.com/help/articles/360025446073-Guide-to-mobile-notifications#how-notifications-work) is the guide on notifications on your phone. You can choose to get notifications immediately from specific channels. To notify a person in a channel, you can tag that person using **@their name**. You can tag the active members of an entire channel **@channel** or **@here** for people who are currently online (and in the channel).

You can choose to download the phone app, the desktop app, or even just rely on the website version. Slack makes switching between accounts, both on mobile and desktop, easy. Updating your personal notifications is also easy, and customizable by channel. Click "gui2de" on the top right then the Preferences screen.

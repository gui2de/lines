### Number of participants per session
- To effectively have everyone’s participation, the ideal number per training session should be
about 10 with a **maximum of 15**. Higher numbers make it difficult to involve everyone in the
training and also makes it difficult to track attendance like people dropping off from the calls.

### Training agenda
- A sample training agenda [can be accessed here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WlauLmwBfrxpBU8nvEIxxssnjE471xt9/view?usp=sharing) for guidance on how
the training session can be organized.
- The training session can be longer than expected due to
technology challenges and it is advisable to have a day after training for recap to make sure field
officers never missed out on any parts of the training.

### Use of zoom
- Video calls are good but can be messy if internet connection is not stable. Audio calls are much
better with less challenges in voices and stability of internet.
- Encourage field officers to join the zoom calls 30 minutes before the training start time. They
can use that time to catch up but mainly assist each other troubleshoot and practice how to use
zoom. i.e. muting and unmuting, voice controls, chatting everyone and individuals etc.
- Encourage field officers to use the chat option to pass communication in case they are facing
challenges hearing or have any comments/ questions. It’s one of the ways to know that they are
following the conversation.
- All field officers should be instructed to mute their audios unless speaking to avoid background
noises. Sometimes they may forget or have problems muting so the trainer can mute and
unmute them on his/ her end.

###  Use of training materials
- The training materials should be attached on the zoom invite and also shared on the whatsapp
group as back up.
- Field officers should be able to view the survey (pdf format) on their tablet and also use zoom at
the same time. We however encourage those who find it easier to use paper format to print the
training materials and get a receipt for the expenses to be reimbursed.
- PowerPoint presentation can be projected by the trainer by sharing his/her screen and going
through the presentation. Remember the field officers need to also use the same tablet to
access the other training materials so you do not want to share your screen throughout the
training.

###  Going through Questionnaire
- Just like the physical training, the team has to go through the questionnaire question by
question before they can practice it on their tablets. We found it easier when each field officer is
assigned a module/ section to lead beforehand. He/ she will read out the questions loud and
guide the discussion. The trainer will come in to clarify any questions or provide additional
information where necessary.
- Going through the survey on the tablet and checking skip patterns is done offline. Field officers
are instructed to log off zoom and look at the survey on their own and afterwards do a mock
interview by calling their colleagues as respondents. They would then conduct a full survey and
submit it. This activity should take about 3 hours inclusive of their lunch break and the team can
reconvene afterwards for a debrief.

###  Piloting the survey
- If it’s possible to find pilot respondents, the second day of training can be used for the pilot so as
to vigorously test the survey instrument and also provide clear estimations of how long the survey would take. Create a day between piloting and actual start date to allow time to
deliberate and make necessary adjustments on the survey instrument.
- The alternative is a soft launch where you start by doing less surveys and using the data to make
necessary adjustments on the survey instrument. Do this at the end of the week to allow
changes to be made over the weekend or create a one-day break to allow the team deliberate
and make any necessary adjustments.

- Ensure survey is short (not more than 30 minutes, ideally closer to 15) and questions are straight forward. On average, you need not to have more than 200 questions though this is dependent on the type of questions and skip patterns.
    - One strategy of making the survey shorter is by having some modules/ questions randomly alternate between respondents so that not all respondents are asked all the questions.
    - Another strategy is to avoid the free text responses, which typically take more time. For example, replace the "Other (specify)" by just "Other" without a follow-up.
- Replace multiple choice questions by tables of single choice yes/no questions going through each of the individual options, to ensure each option is clearly listed out

# Practices
- No data is ever downloaded to your personal machine outside of Box Sync or Box Drive
- Data is never shared over email. Data sharing folders are set up for each partner to drop data in it.

# encryption + key management
- Surveycto forms are encrypted end-to-end using a public/private key pair stored in gui2de Box and shared only with team members who need to download the data

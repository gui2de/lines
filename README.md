# Welcome to the _gui2de_**lines**

## Onboarding 

### Software and accounts setup

To collaborate with gui2de staff and faculty:
- Set up your [Slack](1-software-setup/slack.md) account
- Check your [Zoom](1-software-setup/zoom.md) parameters
- Create a Github account and download Gitkraken or Github Desktop
- Create an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account (free account, no pro subscription needed)

For your coding needs and assignments, you may need: [ArcGIS](1-software-setup/arcgis.md), [Stata16](1-software-setup/stata16.md), Python, R.

### Files and folders access

- Ask BÃ©atrice to set up your [surveycto](https://gui2de.surveycto.com) account
- Ask collaborators to add you to the Google Drive (programmatic) and Box (data) folders
- Download [Box Drive](https://box.georgetown.edu/) to sync data on your computer
- (optional) Download [Google Drive for Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) to sync programmatic folders to your computer
- (optional) Access the gui2de [server](1-software-setup/server.md) if your project has folders on it

Note that Box Drive and Google Drive both do not locally download files onto your computer, unless you explicitly ask them to sync some folders for offline access. As such, they shouldn't take space on your laptop, but will allow you to collaborate by sharing file paths and file versions seamlessly.

### Ethics Training

To contribute to existing research projects:
- Set up your [IRB](2-research-ethics/IRB_indiv.md) account and complete the CITI Training
- Fill out your [Financial Conflict of Interest](2-research-ethics/COI.md) disclosure

## Research Project Lifecycle

### Research Design

- Treatment arms and study design
- Enrollment plan
- Power calculations

### Ethical Approval

To start a new research project:
- [Create a new study](2-research-ethics/IRB_study.md) in the IRB system to seek IRB approval
- [Amend an existing study](2-research-ethics/IRB_amend.md) in the IRB system 

### Data Collection

#### General

1. [Map](3-data-collection/data-mapping.md) project data and define project codebooks and documentation  
1. Create a [SurveyCTO](3-data-collection/survey-cto.md) 
1. Prepare the data collection workplan
1. Test and pilot the survey in the field
1. Train enumerators and update survey from their feedback
1. Run [High Frequency Checks](3-data-collection/hfc.md) during data collection
1. Run [Backchecks](3-data-collection/backcheck.md)

#### Remote 

1. Prepare your [Workplan](3-data-collection-remote/workplan-remote.md) for remote data collection
1. Adapt our [template protocol](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hb7OxQlFTymBOYGE_Y8qFdAjRoPnKVeC/view?usp=sharing) to your survey needs
1. Prepare the [Cases](3-data-collection-remote/cases.md) dataset (the sample to be surveyed) for online callsheet management
1. Create a [SurveyCTO](3-data-collection/survey-cto.md) and rememebr to adapt your [survey questions](3-data-collection-remote/survey-writing-remote.md) to phone data collection
1. Code the [Callsheet](3-data-collection-remote/callsheet.md) within your SurveyCTO survey
1. Prepare [training](3-data-collection-remote/training-remote.md) materials and train enumerators over [Zoom](1-software-setup/zoom.md)
1. Run [High Frequency Checks](3-data-collection-remote/hfc-remote.md) during data collection
1. Run [Backchecks](3-data-collection-remote/backcheck-remote.md)

### Data Management

- Follow standard [folder structure](4-data-management/folder-structure.md)
- Follow standard [security](4-data-management/security.md) practices
- Follow standard [reproductibility](4-data-management/reproductibility.md) practices

### Data Analysis

- Pre Analysis Plan

The process to develop a survey is the following

## When creating a new survey from scratch
1. Create a Google Doc document in the Project [folder](../4-data-management/folder-structure.md) following the [Gdoc survey template]() to define survey modules and survey questions
    1. Classic [survey modules](survey-writing.md)
    1. Tips to write [good survey questions](survey-writing.md)
    1. Tips to write [good survey questions for phone data collection](../3-data-collection-remote/survey-writing-remote.md)
1. Use Google Doc comments, tracked changes and assigned tasks to make revisions on this document as a team
1. Set a time and date for the switch from Google Doc to Google Sheets (SurveyCTO form), mark the Google Doc ARCHIVED and code the first SurveyCTO draft of the survey in Google Sheets
    1. SurveyCTO training
1. In the Google Sheet, add the following tabs: cover sheet, modules, comments, changes following the [Gsheet survey template]()
1. Use the comments tab and the assigned tasks to make revisions on the survey as a team
1. Generate the pdf automatically from SurveyCTO for external partners and/or IRB review (never revert back to the Gdoc or other manually updated survey document)

## When creating a survey from an old one (eg a midline or endline from a baseline)
1. Duplicate the Google Sheet of the old survey in the Project [folder](../4-data-management/folder-structure.md) 
1. Update the Settings tab : survey ID, survey name, encryption key if needed
1. In the Google Sheet, add the following tabs: cover sheet, modules, comments, changes following the [Gsheet survey template]()
1. Use the comments tab and the assigned tasks to make revisions on the survey as a team
1. Generate the pdf automatically from SurveyCTO for external partners and/or IRB review
